# myClinicProject

This project is an Android mobile application designed to simplify and ease patients or the public to reserve an appointment with their chosen doctors under a clinic. 
Everything from the user interfaces down to the last semicolon of code is made from scratch. 
This application is developed and can be run on an IDE software named Android Studio.

The programming language used is Java.

MyClinic is currently under development as it strives to improve its usability to be the same quality as or better from the highly-sought applications that are currently
in the market right now.

#This will be updated as the project progress moves along.
